# This is a sample file just to learn and see how pycharm is integrated with github
# Create a pycharm new project and then from the main menu, select VCS-> create github repository.
# Create a new .py file and
# This line is added in github and then a pull/ fetch will be done on local machine to check if the updated file can be
# fetched in pycharm. The fetch command in pycharm did not work but the pull command is able to merge the changes.
# This line is added in pycharm now to see if commit + push is sufficient to commit the changes to github repo.
# Doing direct push doesn't work but in pycharm if user does commit followed by push then it works.

# If there is a local repo but there is no repo on git then the local changes cannot be pushed to github.
# User needs to create a repo on github and then commit changes from local machine.

# Editing only on github to see diff in local copy and the one in the repo

# Use fetch to get this change onto the local repository.
