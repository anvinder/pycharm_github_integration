# This is a sample file just to learn and see how pycharm is integrated with github
# Create a pycharm new project and then from the main menu, select VCS-> create github repository.
# Create a new .py file and
# This line is added in github and then a pull/ fetch will be done on local machine to check if the updated file can be
# fetched in pycharm. The fetch command in pycharm did not work but the pull command is able to merge the changes.
# This line is added in pycharm now to see if commit + push is sufficient to commit the changes to github repo.
